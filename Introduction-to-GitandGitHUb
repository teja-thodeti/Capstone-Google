# Introduction
Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in source code.
GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories with additional collaboration features.

# Installation of Git Bash
Steps:
Visit https://git-scm.com/

Download the installer for your operating system.

Run the installer and follow the setup wizard (default options are recommended).

After installation, open Git Bash from the Start menu.

Verify the installation:
git --version
# Git Configuration
Set global username and email for commit history tracking:
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
Check your configuration:
git config --list
# Creating and Cloning a Repository
A. Creating a Repository on GitHub:
Go to https://github.com

Click âž• â†’ "New Repository"

Provide a name (e.g., Project-X)

Do not initialize with a README (if planning to push an existing project)

Click "Create Repository"

B. Cloning the Repository Locally:
git clone https://github.com/username/Project-X.git
cd Project-X
# Using Git Locally (Basic Commands)
Add Files:
git add .
Commit Changes:

git commit -m "Initial commit with project files"
Check Status:
git status
# Authentication Methods
A. HTTPS with Personal Access Token (PAT)
GitHub no longer supports password-based authentication. You must use a PAT.

Go to GitHub â†’ Settings â†’ Developer Settings â†’ Personal Access Tokens

Generate a token with required scopes (e.g., repo)

Use the token as your password when prompted

B. SSH Authentication (Recommended)
Generate an SSH key:
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@example.com"
Add the key to GitHub:
Copy the key: cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
Go to GitHub â†’ Settings â†’ SSH and GPG Keys â†’ Add new SSH key
Change the remote URL:
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/Project-X.git
# Pushing Code to GitHub
If this is the first push:
git push -u origin main
If your branch is named master instead of main, replace main with master.
For regular updates:
git push
# Common Errors and Their Fixes
Error Message	Cause	Solution
fatal: repository not found	Incorrect URL or repo access issue	Verify repo URL and your GitHub permissions
Permission denied (publickey)	SSH key not added to GitHub	Add your SSH key to GitHub
Updates were rejected because the remote contains work...	Local and remote are out of sync	Run git pull origin main --rebase
src refspec main does not match any	Branch main doesn't exist locally	Check branch name using git branch, and push with correct name

ðŸ§ª Example: Full Workflow from Scratch
bash
Copy
Edit
# Install Git Bash and open terminal
git config --global user.name "Teja Thodeti"
git config --global user.email "teja@example.com"

# Clone GitHub repo
git clone https://github.com/teja-thodeti/Capstone-Google.git
cd Capstone-Google

# Add files and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
âœ… Conclusion
This guide outlines a complete setup and workflow for using Git and GitHub, from installation to deployment. Following these steps ensures a proper version control system is in place, enhancing collaboration and project management efficiency.
